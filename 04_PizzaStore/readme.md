**Abstract Factory** - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Factory Method** - Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.

Key notes:
- Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes.
