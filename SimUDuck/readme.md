>**The Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Key notes:
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favour composition over inheritance (has-a can be better that is-a)
